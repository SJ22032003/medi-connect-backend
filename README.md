# MediConnect Backend

This repository contains the backend implementation for MediConnect, a healthcare platform that aims to transform healthcare delivery, access, and management by connecting patients, healthcare providers, and stakeholders. The backend is responsible for handling data storage, business logic, and API endpoints.

## Tech Stack

The backend of MediConnect is built using the following technologies and frameworks:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime that allows running JavaScript code on the server-side.
- **Express.js**: A popular web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and retrieving data related to users, healthcare providers, appointments, and other entities in the system.
- **Mongoose**: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB, providing a simple and elegant way to interact with the database.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability by adding static types.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens are used for authentication and authorization purposes, allowing secure communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Firebase Storage**: A cloud-based service for storing and serving files and images. It is used for file and image uploading in the MediConnect backend.
- **Socket.IO**: A library that enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the server and clients using WebSockets. It is used for real-time chatting functionality in MediConnect.

## Implementation

The backend implementation of MediConnect follows a modular and organized structure. Here's a high-level overview of the main components:

- **Routes**: The routes directory contains modules that define the API endpoints and their corresponding request handlers. It handles incoming HTTP requests, validates input data, and invokes the appropriate controller functions.
- **Controllers**: The controllers directory contains modules that handle the business logic for different operations. They interact with the database models, perform data manipulations, and return responses to the client.
- **Models**: The models directory contains the schema definitions for the MongoDB collections. It defines the structure of the data stored in the database and provides methods for querying and manipulating the data.
- **Middlewares**: The middlewares directory contains custom middleware functions used for authentication, authorization, input validation, error handling, and other common tasks.
- **Config**: The config directory contains configuration files, such as environment variables, database connection settings, and other system-specific configurations.
- **Utils**: The utils directory contains utility functions that are used across the application for common tasks, such as file and image uploading to Firebase Storage, data formatting, error handling, etc.
- **Socket**: The socket directory contains modules responsible for handling real-time chatting functionality using Socket.IO. It manages socket connections, event handling, and broadcasting messages between clients.

## Deployment

The MediConnect backend can be deployed to various cloud platforms or hosting providers. For development and testing purposes, you can choose a free server hosting service like Render.com. However, for better performance, scalability, and power, it is recommended to use services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform. These platforms offer a wide range of deployment options, such as virtual machines, containers, and serverless functions, allowing you to choose the most suitable setup for your application.

Additionally, to ensure the quality and reliability of the backend, it is essential to implement tests and set up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests should be written to validate the functionality of different modules and components. CI/CD pipelines can automate the build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that the backend is thoroughly tested and deployed to production environments in a controlled and efficient manner.

## Conclusion

The backend of MediConnect is built using a modern tech stack, including Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB
